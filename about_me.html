    <h2> Most Recent Trip</h2>
    <p> The most recent trip that I have taken was a long time ago but it was to India to visit family. 
        Each day was visting a different part and also trying out all the different food vendors whether that was street food or restaurants. 
        Favorite part as always was feeding the monkeys bread which I still find strange cause we usually think bananas with monkeys but it is always fun.

    <h2>Favorite Pet Names</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Dog: Luna</li>
        <li> Cat: Johnathan</li>
        <li> Turtle: The Flash</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Favorite Restaurant</h2>
    <a href = "https://www.thecheesecakefactory.com" target="_blank"> The Cheesecake Factory </a> <p> I chose this restaurant because I really like cheesecake and according to their name, this is the birthplace of cheesecake.</p>

    <h2>Favorite Food</h2>

    <span> I usually only have it around my birthday and I like to have the chocolate version that has chocolate swirls in the cheese part itself and then also some brownies bits in it. One slice of that and some nice rainy weather makes the best experience.</span>
